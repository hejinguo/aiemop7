	<!--<p>This is an example of tab bar application layout. The main point of such tabbed layout is that each tab contains independent view with its own routing and navigation.</p>
	<p>Each tab/view may have different layout, different navbar type (dynamic, fixed or static) or without navbar like this tab.</p>
	<p>And of course, your favorite panels are still here:
		<a href="#" class="open-panel">left</a> and
		<a href="#" data-panel="right" class="open-panel">right</a>
	</p>
	<p>Icons and their labels in tab bar below are just for example and don't related to their content.</p>
	<a href="about.html">{{bigdatas}}</a>-->
